- rsyslog is unix based package to capture the logs in a connected network. This entails having centralized logging using rsyslog. 
- rsyslog is based on the top of syslog. 
- rsyslog reads the log in syslog daemon service.
- rsyslog will run on a logging server. Description of this logging server will be provided as a part of logging configuration.
- Using some configuration files as rules, the user can define the logs he/she is interested in and can direct them to a defined file.
- These files are core files which define how rsyslog centralized logging would work. 
- Since this implementation uses daemon services, it is necessary to run containerized tink services in root privileges. 
- All core tink services (including worker) would be using rsyslog implementation only and syslog as the log driver. It has been done to ensure logging of core services is correct and consistent. 
- docker-compose file has the logging configurations for tink services on provisioner. For tink-worker changes will be osie at workflow-helper.sh
- Action containers will have the logging as rsys or other (if user-defined).
- logging configuratoin for action containers can be passed via template or configuration file. 
- These details can be passed to tink-worker/action.go as `HostConfig`.
- tls and Log rotation support would be added.
